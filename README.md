## üìñ Overview
Blockchain for FinTech (COMP1830) focuses on designing a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) system for Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes. This project evaluates various blockchain technologies including Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Corda. It explores proof of stake (PoS) and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus methods. The goal is to propose a hybrid architecture that balances privacy, scalability, and compliance with regulations like GDPR. This repository contains a full academic report, architecture decision records, and placeholders for lab exercises.
